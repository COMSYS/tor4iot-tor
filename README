Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

This is an extended Version of Tor enabling IoT devices to communicate anonymously.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

Make sure that you build this version of Tor against OpenSSL with DTLS functionality.
Tested with OpenSSL 1.1.0i.

You can also enable measurements by enabling the MACRO TOR4IOT_MEASUREMENT.

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository:
        sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
